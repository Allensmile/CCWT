# CCWT library for C and Python
Complex [continuous wavelet transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wavelet_transform)
- with a [gabor wavelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_wavelet)
- interfaces for C99, python2.7 and python3.5
- using [libFFTW](http://www.fftw.org) for performance
- and [libPNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) as possible output
- 6 render modes
- parallelization / multithreading support
- customizable frequency bands
- helper method for linear and exponential frequency bands


## Documentation

### ccwt.fft()
- input_signal: Numpy 1D float32, float64, complex64 or complex128 array
- padding: Zero samples to be virtually added at each end of the input signal, default is 0
- thread_count: Default is 1 / no multi threading

### ccwt.frequency_band()
- height: Height of the resulting image in pixels and number of frequencies to analyze
- frequency_range: Difference between the highest and the lowest frequency to analyze, default is height/2
- frequency_offset: Lowest frequency to analyze, default is 0.0
- frequency_basis: Values > 0.0 switch from a linear to an exponential frequency scale using this as basis, default is 0.0 / linear mode
- deviation: Values near 0.0 have better frequency resolution, values towards infinity have better time resolution, default is 1.0

### ccwt.numeric_output()
- fourier_transformed_signal: Numpy 1D complex128 array generated by ccwt.fft()
- frequency_band: Numpy 2D float64 array generated by ccwt.frequency_band()
- width: Width of the resulting image in pixels, can be the length of the input signal or less for downsampling
- padding: Same value as passed to ccwt.fft()
- thread_count: Default is 1 / no multi threading

### ccwt.render_png()
Same as ccwt.numeric_output() but with these two at the beginning:
- path: Filename of the resulting PNG image
- render_mode: indicating the color scheme for rendering, see include/render_mode.h for possible values
